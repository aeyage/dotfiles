# Preface

[WIP]

This repo contains the details of my personal setup on OS X/macOS for my future Mac's so that I wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. It takes quite the effort to manually download and install stuff—tools, SDKs, configs, and everything in between, from scratch and might risk forgetting a component that pieces our machines together which could lead to a breakage.

>[!NOTE]
> Best suited for casual/everyday use and dev. Power users and software/ML/data engineers will find this particularly useful.

And if you do, consider [buying me a cup of coffee]() perchance? ❤️

## Prerequisites ##

To get started setting up a new Mac, launch Terminal—native command-line interface emulator on macOS, and run `xcode-select --install && sudo xcodebuild -license accept` to install Xcode CLI tools and accept Xcode licenses.

## Fresh Setup


## macOS Defaults ##
[.macos]() stores default configurations from Terminal in a shell script.

### Executing the .macos file ###

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults: `./.macos`
